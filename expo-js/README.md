# expo-js

## Getting Started

```sh
# create this project
yarn create expo-app expo-js
```

## Add web support

```sh
yarn expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/webpack-config
```

## Trouble-shooting

- `Missing package "webpack-dev-server" in the project` error when executing `yarn web`

```sh
yarn add -D expo-cli
```
